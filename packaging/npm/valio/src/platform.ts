// Shared platform resolution for the ValIO npm wrapper.
//
// The wrapper package ships no binary of its own. Instead it declares one
// optional dependency per supported platform, each carrying a single prebuilt
// executable, and npm installs only the one matching the host's os/cpu.
//
// The scope of those packages is tied to the repository owner, because GitHub
// Packages — which hosts the preview channels — refuses any package scoped
// differently. Rather than hardcode it in two places and have a rename silently
// break resolution, the package name is discovered at runtime from the
// wrapper's own `optionalDependencies`. That manifest is stamped at publish time
// (see .github/scripts/prepare-npm.mjs) and is the single source of truth for
// which packages this build expects.
