// postinstall: makes the platform binary executable on Unix-like systems.
//
// npm installs only the per-platform optional dependency that matches the
// host's os/cpu. After install, the file ships without the executable bit on
// non-Windows hosts because npm strips perms during pack/unpack. We chmod 755
// here so `valio` works without the user having to fix it themselves.
//
// On Windows, .exe needs no chmod and PATHEXT handles it.
//
// This script must NEVER exit non-zero. A failed postinstall would break
// `npm install` for users who legitimately don't need the binary right away
// (e.g. CI caches, no-op installs) and there's no recoverable action they
// can take from here.
